					<h2>Who we are</h2>
					<p>Affordable Scapes offer a broad range of quality professional services. 
					Our focus is on low maintenance, drought tolerant sustainable gardens. It 
					is our aim to provide you with a garden that will continue to grow and 
					develop long after our work has completed.</p>
					<p>We believe in getting it right from the very first step. Just like 
					building a house requires solid foundations, your garden needs the right 
					start to life to achieve optimum potential. While preparation isn’t always 
					obvious, our commitment from the first step will ensure the best results 
					for a strong and healthy sustainable garden.</p>
					<p>Although we are only small in numbers, we are pride driven and very 
					committed to each job we undertake. We offer personalised service and our 
					professionalism and hard work ethic is second to none.</p>
					<p>We are able to work with a vast range of budgets and we even can work in 
					stages to ease the pressure on the hip pocket. Our photos show only a tiny 
					portion of how we can transform your house, more importantly we invite you 
					to view work we have done in your particular area.</p>
					<p>In a nutshell we are passionate about what we do and if you would 
					like us to add a touch of homeliness to your house, we are only a phone 
					call away.</p>

					<h2>Where we are</h2>

<p>Our warehouse is situated in Derrimut and the bulk of our work is in the Western and Northern suburbs, a majority of that being in Point Cook, Tarneit, Hoppers Crossing, Werribee, Hillside, Taylors Lakes, Caroline Springs and Taylors Hill. As we are only a couple of minutes off the Ring Road, we readily travel right across Melbourne. We have beautified homes from Melton To Cranbourne, in fact there isn't anywhere in Victoria that we have said no to yet!
